       "  'text': 'Coronavirus: A Facebook User’s Experience Of Getting Tested In AbujaATTENTION: PRESIDENCY & FED. MINISTRY OF HEALTH To tell you the truth, NCDC can\\'t do anything for you because they are not ready.All this PR they are doing they are assuming people will not try that\\'s why.On Wednesday (25/03/2020) I and a colleague of mine decided we want to be sure of our status before going into #selfisolation.So we went through the following steps1. We called the toll free line and after all the normal recorded stories, when we chose to speak to an agent they end the call.2. We went to University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, they told us they don\\'t do testing there, that the hospital is only an isolation center. They refer us back to NCDC office in town, told us that\\'s where testing lab is.3. We drove to NCDC office at Jabi. There are two NCDC offices there in close proximity. The first office told us they don\\'t do testing but they directed us to the second office saying that\\'s where testing is handled.4. The second office too absolved themselves of that responsibility and directed us to NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Gaduwa.5. We visited the NCDC NRL. On getting there, the security at the gate informed us that a lot of people were there too earlier in the day and were turned away. That they don\\'t do testing for individuals unless your state took your sample and submit to them. 6.They refer us to a circular posted at the gate and told us to contact the FCT Epidemiology team lead on COVID-19.7. When I called him  I introduced myself by name and then asked him if he\\'s the FCT  team lead on this issue. He answered yes. I then asked him how do I go about getting tested. He asked who are you? Who gave you my number? I told him I\\'m an Abuja resident and his number is on a circular at the NCDC  office. He told us he doesn\\'t know. He said we should go to NCDC. I told him but they referred us to you. He was silent. I then asked him to advise us. He told us to go to \"National Health Disease Control\" which doesn\\'t exist.I will send a copy of the circular to this forum.Obviously they are doing selective testing which is dangerous.It means a lot of people might have been infected already but for lack of testing they are moving about infecting others.While the information from the official channels are saying people are not coming forth, the truth is that people are going but are been turned away.And I know because I was turned away first hand.It also tells you  that either the NCDC are lying to us or they are not coordinated at all. How will you explain three branches of the office each denying responsibility and pointing us to the next instead of just explaining to us the laid down procedures by the NCDChttps://m.facebook.com/673827759324224/posts/3897292313644403/',\n",

Guy please stop making laughable arguments, it will permanently soil your online reputation, remember your comments can be dug up later in life. President Trump displayed no symptoms either, but he was in a meeting with people who tested positive and he had to get tested. Of course members of the top ruling class such are presidents, prime ministers, governors etc should be tested if they think they might have come in contact with anyone who tested positive. Do you know how chaotic Nigeria will be if President Buhari was to test positive and die from COVID-19? Now imagine the same thing happening to Trump the leader of the free world. It will be chaotic and disruptive. The stock market will crash even further, there will be destability, and that my friend is one of the reasons why people like El Rufai get tested, symptomatic or not. Moreover, how do you know he had no symptoms?',\n",

God help us for our hope is in  the name of the Almighty God.[quotqe author=SinisterX post=87885451]Coronavirus: A Facebook User’s Experience Of Getting Tested In AbujaATTENTION: PRESIDENCY & FED. MINISTRY OF HEALTH To tell you the truth, NCDC can\\'t do anything for you because they are not ready.All this PR they are doing they are assuming people will not try that\\'s why.On Wednesday (25/03/2020) I and a colleague of mine decided we want to be sure of our status before going into #selfisolation.So we went through the following steps1. We called the toll free line and after all the normal recorded stories, when we chose to speak to an agent they end the call.2. We went to University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, they told us they don\\'t do testing there, that the hospital is only an isolation center. They refer us back to NCDC office in town, told us that\\'s where testing lab is.3. We drove to NCDC office at Jabi. There are two NCDC offices there in close proximity. The first office told us they don\\'t do testing but they directed us to the second office saying that\\'s where testing is handled.4. The second office too absolved themselves of that responsibility and directed us to NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Gaduwa.5. We visited the NCDC NRL. On getting there, the security at the gate informed us that a lot of people were there too earlier in the day and were turned away. That they don\\'t do testing for individuals unless your state took your sample and submit to them. 6.They refer us to a circular posted at the gate and told us to contact the FCT Epidemiology team lead on COVID-19.7. When I called him  I introduced myself by name and then asked him if he\\'s the FCT  team lead on this issue. He answered yes. I then asked him how do I go about getting tested. He asked who are you? Who gave you my number? I told him I\\'m an Abuja resident and his number is on a circular at the NCDC  office. He told us he doesn\\'t know. He said we should go to NCDC. I told him but they referred us to you. He was silent. I then asked him to advise us. He told us to go to \"National Health Disease Control\" which doesn\\'t exist.I will send a copy of the circular to this forum.Obviously they are doing selective testing which is dangerous.It means a lot of people might have been infected already but for lack of testing they are moving about infecting others.While the information from the official channels are saying people are not coming forth, the truth is that people are going but are been turned away.And I know because I was turned away first hand.It also tells you  that either the NCDC are lying to us or they are not coordinated at all. How will you explain three branches of the office each denying responsibility and pointing us to the next instead of just explaining to us the laid down procedures by the NCDChttps://m.facebook.com/673827759324224/posts/3897292313644403/[/quote]',\n",

During this corona season, for the common Nigerians, two things are involved: either you catch it or you don\\'t catch it.If you catch it, two things are involved: either you get lucky, be tested and be treated as one of the \"confirmed cases\" or you are unlucky.If you are unlucky, two things are involved: either you obey and stay at home or you continue going about as an unintentional dispersal agent.In both instances, two things are still involved: you may develop symptoms and know that you have it without this official testing or you may just be divinely cured without showing any symptom, thereby not being counted in corona records.If you have symptoms, two things are still involved: if and when you reach the corona hospital, either you get admitted or you are told to wait in a long queue, that the hospital is already filled up and there is no space for you.If and when you finally get admitted, two things are still involved: with or without treatment, your condition either stays \"stable\" like those in the news or you will become serious and then require intensive care.If you require intensive care, two things are involved: the doctor decides whether you deserve to live and puts you on a ventilator or they simply become too busy to pay attention to you and asks you to wait.If they become too busy for you, only one thing will be involved: you will know exactly how many ventilators there are in your country and exactly who are using them at that moment.Then, you will remember God and  begin to pray always if you hadn\\'t been the powerful type.Prevention is better than cure.

You had no history of travel and no history of exposure with a positive case but yet decided to get tested rather than practicing social distancing. NCDC criteria for getting tested are as follows:1) Anyone with a recent travel history who present with fever, cough or breathing within 14 days of arrival2) Anyone exposed to a confirmed case with the above symptoms within 14 days from point of contact3) Any of the above 2 with no symptoms. This is a plus/minus cos most people under this careful should self isolate...The poster doesn\\'t fit into any of these 3. So why does he want to get tested? There aren\\'t enough testing kits in this country or anywhere in the world for the people showing symptoms let alone the asymptomatic ones with no travel or contact with a confirmed case. No. Ghana doesn\\'t provide door to door testingNo. Germany doesn\\'t do half a million tests weeklyNo. USA doesn\\'t do tests for everyone that requests for itYes. Nigeria tests close contacts with a confirmed case by doing what we call contact tracing.USA health workers have erred their complaints even just yesterday on the limited equipments and their doctors/nurses treating the cases not being tested. Any news you read is about private organizations ordering test kits for their employees. Davido and his family should\\'ve gone into quarantine the first minute they dropped from the plane but decided to throw a party and exposed others. Their testing is most likely private...Besides, every nation has a problem with selectivity for high profile citizens. The U.S and other European countries have news all over about celebs and politicians with no symptoms getting tested. So how do we tackle this? STAY AT HOME. If you come in contact with a positive case and show no symptoms, QUARANTINEIf you had a recent travel history to high index countries, QUARANTINEIf you don\\'t have any of this, observe strict SOCIAL DISTANCING. Now isn\\'t a time to run to NCDC \"just to get tested\". They have positive cases that need containing and attentionThe whole world doesn\\'t have enough resources to deal with positive cases and worse random testers.
